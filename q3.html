            <h2>What is Responsive Web Design?</h2>
            <p>Responsive Web Design is a web development approach that ensures websites look and function well on a variety of devices and screen sizes â€” from desktop monitors to smartphones and tablets.</p>
            
            <h2>Why its essential?</h2>
            <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is essential today because people access websites on a wide range of devices - not just desktops, but also tablets, smartphones, smart TVs, and even watches. Here's why it's crucial:
                <ul>
                    <li>A responsive website automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, making it easier to read and navigate.</li>
                    <li>No need to zoom or scroll horizontally on mobile devices.</li>
                    <li>Leads to higher user satisfaction and longer time spent on the site.</li>
                    <li>Instead of creating and managing separate desktop and mobile sites, RWD allows one site that works everywhere.</li>
                </ul>
